# Entroware-Apollo-Hackintosh

This is a project I started myself since I have been using the entroware apollo laptop since last year and it is a phenomenal machine. I wanted to really push the hardware and at present I have quad boot set up with Mac OS as well.

A breakdown of what is needed if you do have this laptop and want to hackintosh it:
  1. Follow the opencore guide as strictly as possible:
  https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/
  2. Builds depend on the chipset and general hardware you have
  3. My EFI has the necessary kexts and SSDTs for this particular laptop with the i7-8565U generation which is whiskey lake, newer models will have a slightly different set up
  4. Any questions then respond on this reddit thread:
